Runa
====

Runa is a collection of functions I found myself writing over and over
in my `js_of_ocaml` programming. It does not assume anything other
than what is provided by `js_of_ocaml`, aka no assumption of `nodejs`.
Use this library for yourself as well and make your `OCaml` to
`JavaScript` coding that much easier; even better contribute some
snippets as well!
